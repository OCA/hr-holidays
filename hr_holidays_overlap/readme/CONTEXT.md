This module was developed because standard Odoo does not allow overlapping leaves.

For legislations where being sick during vacation counts as sick day and not a vacation
day, you'd have to cancel the original vacation, and recreate sick leaves / vacation
leaves as necessary.

With this module, you can simply allow overlapping for sick leaves, and add the sick
leave on top of the vacation leave. This will also deduct the sick days taken from the
vacation days taken.
